# Leetcode Practice

## Description

A brief description of what your project is about and what it does.

Example:
This project solves the **Two Sum** problem, a common coding challenge where you find two numbers in an array that add up to a given target. The solution uses efficient hashing for a time complexity of O(n).

## Features

- Find two numbers in an array that sum to a target value.
- Efficient O(n) time complexity using a hash map.
- Handles a variety of edge cases and inputs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- A package manager like `pip` to install dependencies.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the solution in your Python environment:
    ```bash
    python solution.py
    ```

2. Example usage:
    ```python
    solution = Solution()
    result = solution.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
    print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
    ```
